For my final CIS project, I decided to create a tennis tournament predictor app. In this app, the user can input numbers from 0-100 from a variety of different statistics ranging from serve, forehand, backhand, etc. and a predetermined algorithm will decide which player in the list of players the user inputs is most likely to win a hypothetical
tennis tournament.
